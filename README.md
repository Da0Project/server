## **What will Da0 do**

### **Discord bot for DAO management**

Da0 is building tools for managing DAO on discord. Through Da0’s discord bot ”Da0”, you can manage DAO tasks, DAO members more efficiently.

### Features

#### **Enrollment Automation**

Through the wallet connection in the discord app, Da0 provide the automated authorization in convenient way. When the wallet connection steps, we check the user has the token of the DAO in wallet. Therefore, the manager of the DAO discord don’t have to check if the joined user has the DAO token or DAO’s NFT. Through the Da0 enrollment automation, DAO manager doesn’t have to use the Google form or check if the user hold the token of DAO one by one because Da0 check the authority and store the information and provide it as the API.

#### **DAO Information Aggregator**

Many DAO’s struggle is providing DAO’s information to anonymous user to join their DAO, but it is hard to provide information and aggregate it in the discord. To solve this problem, by using our application, by typing simple slash command, user can view DAO’s information such as number of DAO’s token holder, DAO treasury balance and overall information of the DAO.

#### **New Proposal Alert**

As the on-chain information is separated from the off-chain, the vote rate of the DAO is the one of the biggest problem. Therefore, the Da0 provide the on-going proposal alert for the members, and proposal information such as voting status, voting period and snapshot.
